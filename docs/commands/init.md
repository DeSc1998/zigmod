## `init` command
```
zigmod init
```

This command will help you generate a `zig.mod` file and place it in the current directory. This is the main file that will define various pieces of metadata about your project and manage your dependencies. The command will guide you though a number of questions that help you setup supporting files as well such as `.gitignore` and `LICENSE`.

Check out the [`zig.mod` reference](./../zig.mod.md) for more info.

Also check out `zigmod`'s own `zig.mod` for a useful example: https://github.com/nektro/zigmod/blob/master/zig.mod.
