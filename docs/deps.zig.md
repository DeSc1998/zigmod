## `deps.zig` Reference
This file is generated by [`zigmod fetch`](commands/fetch.md) or [`zigmod ci`](commands/ci.md) and is an amalgamation of all of the sources and dependencies used in this project. Many of the fields listed here align with fields present in [`zigmod.yml`](zig.mod.md) but contain those values for the entire dependency tree.

### `cache`
- Type: `[]const u8`
The relative path root to which all dependency sources are saved. Currently always `.zigmod/deps`.

### `addAllTo`
- Type: `pub fn (exe: *std.build.LibExeObjStep) void`
A helper function to add all of the packages, C files, and system libraries to the passed exectuable. It will also automatically link libC in the event that any C files are found in the dependency tree.

### `Package`
```zig
pub const Package = struct {
    directory: string,
    pkg: ?Pkg = null,
    c_include_dirs: []const string = &.{},
    c_source_files: []const string = &.{},
    c_source_flags: []const string = &.{},
    system_libs: []const string = &.{},
    frameworks: []const string = &.{},
    vcpkg: bool = false,
};
```

### `package_data`
- Type: `struct<ID, Package>`
This is a meta struct that associates ID's to their relavant `Package` definition.

### `packages`
- Type: `[]Package`
This is a an array of all of the items in `package_data`, but only contains the final versions of `dev_dependencies`.

### `pkgs`
- Type: `struct<NAME, Package>`
This is a struct that associates the package name to the relavant `Package`. The only packages listed are the dependencies of the root project. 

### `imports`
- Type: `struct<NAME, @import(main)>`
This is a struct that contains the imports of your `dev_dependencies`. Added in response to [zig#2206](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2206).
